      Summer is here and that means it’s potluck season. Bring on the backyard
      barbecues, the rooftop soirees and the outdoor dinners. Whenever I’m
      invited to these events I always want to bring that one dish that wows the
      other guests. You want to hear people whispering, “What’s in this? Who
      made it? How do I get the recipe?” while they shove another forkful in
      their mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pasta salad is always a good choice to bring to these types of parties: It
      can be made ahead of time and tastes better the longer it sits. But
      there’s one problem ― it can be boring and flavorless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But good news: Making a stellar pasta salad only takes one simple
      ingredient you probably already have in the back of your fridge … pickle
      juice!

      from a jar of pickles isn’t a new phenomenon: It’s been used to marinate
      chicken,

      in athletes. The juice and spices at the bottom of the jar are a delicious
      combination of vinegar, garlic, dill, mustard seeds, peppercorns and
      coriander seeds. It adds a brightness to dishes with a pop of acidity,
      sourness and tang. Think of it as a one-stop shop for flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this recipe, the pickle juice cuts the richness of the mayo in a
      dill-heavy ranch dressing while adding a briny punch of flavor. The pasta
      salad also includes perfectly al dente noodles, a good measure of diced
      pickles, hunks of sharp cheddar cheese, fresh summer tomatoes and of
      course extra crispy thick-cut bacon. It’s basically all of your favorite
      foods combined into one dish and conveniently called a “salad.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time you’re looking to be the culinary superstar of the summer,
      look no further than a jar of pickles. The results will surprise you and
      your friends.
